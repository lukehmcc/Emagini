This project has been dead for a while and if I were to do it again, I would re-write it from scratch so this repo is useless.

It's a basic photo storage app build on the Sia backbone.

Also I moved to gitlab cuz I felt like it... I'm not gonna link it though cuz github might stab me if I link to their competitor.

For live updates and seeing how we program(Don't know why you would want that tho) checkout the dev log!
